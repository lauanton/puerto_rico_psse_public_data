AO3b - BaseCaseUtilityPVLoad_07062018.RAW
AO3C - BaseCaseDERPVLoad_07062018.RAW
AO3D - BaseCaseDERPVGen_07062018.RAW

AO3a is same as A02 except for different cost data. 
GenCostWithPPA.txt is the generator cost information used with A02
GenCostUtilityPVPPAGen.txt is the generator cost information to be used with A03a.
A01, A03c, A03d can use a subset of cost data used with A02.
