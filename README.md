This folder consists of Puerto Rico power system files used with studies summarized in FnT monograph. 

The sub-folders are dedicated to the analyses presnted in the two chapters:
- LL_Report_PartII
The PSSE files in the folder were generated using the GIS data procured by MIT-LL. 
THe final set of files in v30 format for different architectures presented in Chapter II of the monograph. 
Further information provided in the README file in the sub-folder.


- MIT_Report_PartIII
It comprises two different PSSE files used for the two sections presented in Chapter III of the monograph. 
Section 3.3. utilizes the file Base_mod.raw: This file is generated by altering certain line impedances and voltage settings to make the system data more representative of the real Puerto Rico power system data
Section 3.4. utilizes the file high HVGrid_v26.raw: This file is in v26 PSSE format and consists only on the high voltage system and is used to perform robustness assessment with respect to voltage stability.
