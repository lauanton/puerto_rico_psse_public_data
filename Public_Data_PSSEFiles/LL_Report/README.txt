THIS FODLER CONSISTS OF THE BASE CASE FILES USED FOR EACH OF THE ARCHITECTURES.
AO1 - BaseCaseWithOUTPPA_07062018.RAW
AO2 - BaseCaseWithPPA_07062018.RAW
AO3b - BaseCaseUtilityPVLoad_07062018.RAW
AO3C - BaseCaseDERPVLoad_07062018.RAW
AO3D - BaseCaseDERPVGen_07062018.RAW

For definitions of architectures, please refer to the technical report (Contact ilic@mit.edu). 

AO3a is same as A02 except for different cost data. 
GenCostWithPPA.txt is to be used with A02
GenCostUtilityPVPPAGen.txt is to be used with A03a.
A01, A03c, A03d can use a subset of cost data used with A02.
